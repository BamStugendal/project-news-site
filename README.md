# News Site

The first project of the Technigo boot camp was about creating a responsive page layout using flexbox. So I did an inspirational news site where there are new inspirations and creators every day. This time(for the date 28/8) I used myself as a creator and uploaded my own illustrations. 

## The problem

I tested using desktop-first approach and added media queries to style tablets and mobile versions. I used flexbox to layout the articles and make the site responsive. I had a bigger news article then under that a smaller grid of articles. On the smaller grid, I added a hover effect that makes the picture pop. A hamburger pops up and replaces the navbar when going in to tablet mode and under.
